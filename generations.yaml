  - name: "First Generation (R50/R53)"
    start_year: 2001
    end_year: 2006
    description: "The first modern MINI Cooper marked BMW's revival of the iconic British brand, reimagining the classic Mini with modern technology and safety standards while maintaining its distinctive character. The standard Cooper (R50) featured a 1.6-liter Tritec engine producing 115 horsepower, while the high-performance Cooper S (R53) utilized a supercharged version generating 163 horsepower (later increased to 170 hp). The exterior design successfully translated the original Mini's iconic styling cues—including the round headlights, floating roof, and compact dimensions—into a larger, more modern package. The interior featured a distinctive retro-futuristic design with a large central speedometer, toggle switches, and circular theme throughout. Despite its small footprint, the R50/R53 offered surprising interior space efficiency and engaging driving dynamics characterized by the famous 'go-kart feel.' Advanced features for the time included a CVT automatic transmission option, run-flat tires, and various luxury amenities unusual in small cars. The first-generation established the reborn MINI as a premium small car with strong emphasis on customization, offering numerous appearance packages, trim options, and accessories allowing buyers to personalize their vehicles. This generation laid the foundation for MINI's successful expansion under BMW ownership, proving that a premium small car could succeed in the modern market."

  - name: "Second Generation (R56)"
    start_year: 2006
    end_year: 2013
    description: "The second-generation MINI Cooper refined the formula established by its predecessor with evolutionary styling changes and significant mechanical updates. Introduced in July 2006, the Cooper now featured a 1.6-liter Prince engine co-developed with PSA Peugeot Citroën, producing 118 horsepower in naturally aspirated form, while the Cooper S switched from supercharging to turbocharging, generating 172 horsepower (later increased to 181 hp) with improved efficiency. Exterior styling maintained the iconic MINI aesthetic with subtle refinements including a longer front overhang to meet pedestrian safety regulations, reshaped headlights, and more pronounced wheel arches. The interior continued the quirky, retro-inspired design with an even larger central speedometer incorporating entertainment and navigation functions, improved materials, and expanded technology options. New features included keyless ignition, ambient lighting, and a more sophisticated optional navigation system. Customization options expanded further with additional paint colors, roof designs, interior trims, and special editions. Despite increasing slightly in size, the R56 maintained MINI's characteristic nimble handling while offering improved comfort, reduced noise levels, and enhanced safety features. This generation broadened MINI's appeal by balancing the brand's distinctive character with increased refinement and practicality. Production ended in November 2013 for the hatchback, with the convertible variant continuing until 2015."

  - name: "Third Generation (F56)"
    start_year: 2013
    end_year: 2024
    description: "The third-generation MINI Cooper represented a more substantial redesign, built on BMW's new UKL1 front-wheel-drive platform shared with several BMW models. Unveiled in November 2013 with sales beginning in early 2014, it grew in length, width, and wheelbase to improve passenger space and crash protection. Powertrains were completely revised, with the base Cooper now featuring a 1.5-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing 136 horsepower, while the Cooper S utilized a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder generating 192 horsepower. Both engines incorporated BMW's TwinPower Turbo technology for improved efficiency and performance. The exterior design evolved with more rounded forms, larger headlights with optional LED rings, a more prominent grille, and more substantial proportions overall. The interior received a significant modernization with a more conventional instrument cluster positioned behind the steering wheel, a separate 6.5-inch (later 8.8-inch) infotainment display, and higher quality materials throughout. Technology advanced considerably with options including head-up display, active cruise control, collision and pedestrian warning systems, parking assistant, and enhanced connectivity features. A refreshed version was introduced in 2018 with subtle design updates, improved technology, and the addition of a dual-clutch transmission option. A battery-electric version, the Mini Electric (Cooper SE), was launched in 2020. Another refresh, the second Life Cycle Impulse (LCI), was released in 2021 with additional styling and technical updates. This generation maintained MINI's distinctive character and customization options while delivering more refinement, technology, and practicality, positioning the brand more clearly in the premium small car segment. Production ended in 2024, with the combustion-engine variant replaced by the fourth-generation F65/66/67 series."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (J01/F65/66/67)"
    start_year: 2023
    end_year: null
    description: "The fourth-generation MINI Cooper introduces a new design language and platform strategy, diverging into distinct combustion-engine (F65/66/67) and battery-electric (J01) variants. The battery-electric J01 Cooper was unveiled in September 2023 with production starting in October 2023, marketed as the 2024-2025 model year. Developed and produced by Spotlight Automotive in China, the J01 features a simplified interior dominated by a fully circular OLED touchscreen display based on the OS9 operating system. Available as the Cooper E and Cooper SE, the J01 offers different battery capacities: the Cooper E with a 40.7 kWh battery (135 kW/184 hp, 305 km/190 mile range) and the Cooper SE with a 54.2 kWh battery (160 kW/218 hp, 402 km/250 mile range), plus a JCW Electric variant with 190 kW/258 hp. The combustion-engine F65/66/67 was introduced in March 2024 as a heavily refreshed version of the third generation, maintaining similar dimensions and UKL1 platform underpinnings. The F66 (3-door) is available in Cooper C and Cooper S trims with a 1.5-liter turbocharged three-cylinder (156 hp) and 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder (204 hp) respectively, paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. The F65 is the 5-door variant and the F67 is the convertible. The exterior design returns to a cleaner, more minimalist aesthetic inspired by the original Mini, featuring a rounded silhouette, more vertical front end, shorter overhangs, and simplified surfaces. The iconic circular headlights remain but are now framed in a more rectangular outline. Production of the electric J01 is set to begin at the Oxford Plant in 2026. This generation represents MINI's transition toward electrification while maintaining traditional combustion engine options, balancing the brand's heritage with modern technology and sustainability objectives."
