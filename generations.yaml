  - name: "First Generation (R50/R53)"
    start_year: 2001
    end_year: 2006
    description: "The first modern MINI Cooper marked BMW's revival of the iconic British brand, reimagining the classic Mini with modern technology and safety standards while maintaining its distinctive character. The standard Cooper (R50) featured a 1.6-liter Tritec engine producing 115 horsepower, while the high-performance Cooper S (R53) utilized a supercharged version generating 163 horsepower (later increased to 170 hp). The exterior design successfully translated the original Mini's iconic styling cues—including the round headlights, floating roof, and compact dimensions—into a larger, more modern package. The interior featured a distinctive retro-futuristic design with a large central speedometer, toggle switches, and circular theme throughout. Despite its small footprint, the R50/R53 offered surprising interior space efficiency and engaging driving dynamics characterized by the famous 'go-kart feel.' Advanced features for the time included a CVT automatic transmission option, run-flat tires, and various luxury amenities unusual in small cars. The first-generation established the reborn MINI as a premium small car with strong emphasis on customization, offering numerous appearance packages, trim options, and accessories allowing buyers to personalize their vehicles. This generation laid the foundation for MINI's successful expansion under BMW ownership, proving that a premium small car could succeed in the modern market."

    end_year: 2013
    description: "The second-generation MINI Cooper refined the formula established by its predecessor with evolutionary styling changes and significant mechanical updates. The Cooper now featured a 1.6-liter Prince engine co-developed with PSA Peugeot Citroën, producing 118 horsepower in naturally aspirated form, while the Cooper S switched from supercharging to turbocharging, generating 172 horsepower (later increased to 181 hp) with improved efficiency. Exterior styling maintained the iconic MINI aesthetic with subtle refinements including a longer front overhang to meet pedestrian safety regulations, reshaped headlights, and more pronounced wheel arches. The interior continued the quirky, retro-inspired design with an even larger central speedometer incorporating entertainment and navigation functions, improved materials, and expanded technology options. New features included keyless ignition, ambient lighting, and a more sophisticated optional navigation system. Customization options expanded further with additional paint colors, roof designs, interior trims, and special editions. Despite increasing slightly in size, the R56 maintained MINI's characteristic nimble handling while offering improved comfort, reduced noise levels, and enhanced safety features. This generation broadened MINI's appeal by balancing the brand's distinctive character with increased refinement and practicality."

  - name: "Third Generation (F56)"
    start_year: 2014
    end_year: 2023
    description: "The third-generation MINI Cooper represented a more substantial redesign, built on BMW's new UKL1 front-wheel-drive platform shared with several BMW models. Notably larger than its predecessors, it grew in length, width, and wheelbase to improve passenger space and crash protection. Powertrains were completely revised, with the base Cooper now featuring a 1.5-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing 134 horsepower, while the Cooper S utilized a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder generating 189 horsepower. Both engines incorporated BMW's TwinPower Turbo technology for improved efficiency and performance. The exterior design evolved with more rounded forms, larger headlights with optional LED rings, a more prominent grille, and more substantial proportions overall. The interior received a significant modernization with a more conventional instrument cluster positioned behind the steering wheel, a separate 6.5-inch (later 8.8-inch) infotainment display, and higher quality materials throughout. Technology advanced considerably with options including head-up display, active cruise control, collision and pedestrian warning systems, parking assistant, and enhanced connectivity features. A refreshed version was introduced in 2018 with subtle design updates, improved technology, and the addition of a dual-clutch transmission option. This generation maintained MINI's distinctive character and customization options while delivering more refinement, technology, and practicality, positioning the brand more clearly in the premium small car segment."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (J01)"
    start_year: 2024
    end_year: null
    description: "The fourth-generation MINI Cooper introduces a new design language and platform strategy, with the model now diverging into distinct combustion-engine (internal designation J01) and electric (designation J01E) variants sharing similar styling but different underpinnings. The exterior design returns to a cleaner, more minimalist aesthetic inspired by the original Mini, featuring a rounded silhouette, a more vertical front end, shorter overhangs, and simplified surfaces. The iconic circular headlights remain but are now framed in a more rectangular outline. The gasoline-powered Cooper retains the previous generation's powertrains in updated form, with the base Cooper featuring a 1.5-liter turbocharged three-cylinder producing 156 horsepower and the Cooper S utilizing a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder generating 201 horsepower, both paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. The electric Cooper SE offers two battery options: a 40.7 kWh version with 184 horsepower and approximately 190 miles of range, and a larger battery variant with 218 horsepower and up to 250 miles of range. The interior receives a dramatic reimagining with a minimalist dashboard dominated by a large round OLED touchscreen display that incorporates most vehicle functions, with very few physical buttons remaining. New technology includes augmented reality navigation, advanced driver assistance systems, and a more sophisticated voice control system. Despite the technological advancement, the new Cooper maintains similar dimensions to its predecessor, focusing on refinement rather than growth. This generation represents MINI's transition toward electrification while maintaining the option of traditional combustion engines, balancing the brand's heritage with modern technology and sustainability objectives."
